**Customer Segmentation and Analysis Using K-means Clustering**
**Overview**
This project explores customer segmentation using K-means clustering on a Mall Customers dataset. The goal is to identify distinct customer segments based on their age, annual income, and spending score, and provide actionable insights for marketing strategies.

**Features**
**Data Exploration**: Visualize distribution of age, annual income, and spending score.
**K-means Clustering**: Segment customers into clusters based on attributes.
**Insights and Recommendations**: Interpret clusters and provide marketing strategy recommendations.
**Tools and Librarie**s
Python, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
**Installation**
Clone the repository.
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
**Usage**
Open and run main.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.
Follow instructions in the notebook to load data, perform analysis, and interpret results.
**File Descriptions**
main.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing analysis and visualization scripts.
data.csv: Sample dataset of Mall Customers.
**Results**
The analysis revealed five distinct customer segments with varying income levels and spending behaviors. Visualizations illustrate the distribution of clusters and highlight key insights for targeted marketing strategies.

**Future Improvements**
Incorporate additional demographic features for more comprehensive segmentation.
Implement clustering evaluation metrics for model validation.
Develop interactive visualization tools for exploring customer segments.
